This messy python script allows you to create "Hearts of Iron 4 x{number}" mode almost automatically.
In order for it to work, you have to make sure that you've downloaded and installed Python, and that you have Hearts of Iron 4 installed on your hard drive.
To run this script, open CMD or terminal, navigate to folder where you cloned this repository, and type
'python ./x10.py'
Mod files will be generated in ./mod directory.
You can configure this script by modifying the 'config.json' file.
If you want to add any new modifiers, just add them to "modifiers.txt" file. Instructions on how this works are inside the file.

That's all I think...

Have fun decimating Hearts of Iron 4 balance as much as you want!
